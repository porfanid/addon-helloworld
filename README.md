# Stremio addon for Kickass torrents

This is a simple addon for Stremio to watch a couple of movies from Kickass torrents. What it does is to fetch the movies every night at 00:00 and store the data to a file. So, when you want to watch movies, all it does is to fetch the data from the file. You can find a running version of the app here:

[Heroku](https://stremio-kickass.herokuapp.com/)

So what you actually need to do is only open the page. If you want to alter anything, all you need to alter is the files in the fetch folder, as the addon reads the data from that package.
